It stands for Functional Threshold Power and represents the highest average power you could maintain for one hour. If you don't know your FTP, you can find it by doing our Rubber Glove video with a power meter or on virtual watts. For this app, FTP relates to power only so you won't be able to use cadence or heart rate to estimate FTP.",

LTHR is the heart rate you would average if you were to ride an entire hour at threshold. We estimate your LTHR by taking 98% of your max 20 minute average heart rate during Full Frontal. We would like to point out you will need to be fresh during the test to get the most accurate heart rate values.",
